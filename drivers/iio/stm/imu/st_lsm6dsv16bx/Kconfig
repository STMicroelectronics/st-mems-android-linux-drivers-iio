	  Enable internal event detection features like: tilt, step counter, step
	  detection and significant motion. If this feature is enabled it is
	  necessary to extend the iio_chan_type_name_spec array in industrialio-
	  core.c by adding the custom types used by this driver.

	  WARNING If this feature is enabled, it is necessary to extend the
	  iio_chan_type_name_spec array in industrialio-core.c by adding the
	  custom sensor-types used by this driver; otherwise, during the
	  registration phase of the custom sensors on the iio core, a crash
	  could occur due to access to unallocated memory.
