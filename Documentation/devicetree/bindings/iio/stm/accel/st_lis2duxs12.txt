* lis2duxs12 driver for accel MEMS sensors

Required properties for all bus drivers:
- compatible: must be one of:
              "st,lis2dux12"
              "st,lis2duxs12"
              "st,iis2dulpx"

Required properties for the i2c bindings:
- reg: i2c slave address

Required properties for the spi bindings:
- reg:               the chipselect index
- spi-max-frequency: maximal bus speed, should be set to 1000000 unless
                     constrained by external circuitry

Optional properties for all bus drivers:
- st,int-pin:  the pin on the package that will be used to signal when
	       sensor data are available (valid values: 1 or 2, default: 1).

- interrupts:  interrupt mapping for IRQ. It should be configured with
               flags IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH.

               Refer to interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt for generic
               interrupt client node bindings.

- pd_dis_int1: disable pull down on int1 pin.
- pd_dis_int2: disable pull down on int2 pin.
- drive-open-drain: set interrupt pin in open drain (disable push-pull)

Example for an spi device node:

lis2duxs12-accel@0 {
	compatible = "st,lis2duxs12";
	reg = <0x0>;
	spi-max-frequency = <1000000>;
	interrupt-parent = <&gpio0>;
	interrupts = <0 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	st,int-pin = <1>;
};

Example for an i2c device node (I2C slave address 0x19):

lis2duxs12-accel@19 {
	compatible = "st,lis2duxs12";
	reg = <0x19>;
	interrupt-parent = <&gpio0>;
	interrupts = <0 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	st,int-pin = <1>;
};
