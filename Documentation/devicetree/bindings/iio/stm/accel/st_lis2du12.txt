* lis2du12 driver for accel MEMS sensors

Required properties for all bus drivers:
- compatible: must be one of:
              "st,lis2du12"

Required properties for the i2c/i3c bindings:
- reg:         i2c/i3c address of the sensor (for i3c is the static sddress)

Required properties for the spi bindings:
- reg:               the chipselect index

- spi-max-frequency: maximal bus speed, should be set to 10000000 unless
                     constrained by external circuitry

Optional properties for all bus drivers:
- st,int-pin:  the pin on the package that will be used to signal when
               sensor data are available (valid values: 1 or 2, default: 1).

- interrupts:  interrupt mapping for IRQ. It should be configured with
               flags IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH.

               Refer to interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt for generic
               interrupt client node bindings.

- pd_dis_int1: disable pull down on int1 pin.

- pp_od_int:   set int pin to open drain.

Example for an spi device node:

lis2du12-accel@0 {
        compatible = "st,lis2du12";
        reg = <0x0>;
        spi-max-frequency = <10000000>;
        interrupt-parent = <&gpio0>;
        interrupts = <0 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
        st,int-pin = <1>;
};

Example for an i2c device node:

lis2du12@19 {
        compatible = "st,lis2du12";
        reg = <0x19>;
        interrupt-parent = <&gpio>;
        interrupts = <0 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
        st,int-pin = <1>;
};
