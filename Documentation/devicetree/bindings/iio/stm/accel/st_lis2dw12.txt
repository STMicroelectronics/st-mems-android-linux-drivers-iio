* lis2dw12 driver for accel MEMS sensors

Required properties for all bus drivers:
- compatible: must be one of:
              "st,lis2dw12"
              "st,iis2dlpc"
              "st,ais2ih"

Required properties for the i2c bindings:
- reg:             i2c slave address

Required properties for the spi bindings:
- reg:               the chipselect index

- spi-max-frequency: maximal bus speed, should be set to 10000000 unless
                     constrained by external circuitry

Optional properties for all bus drivers:
- st,drdy-int-pin: the pin on the package that will be used to signal
                   "data ready" (valid values: 1 or 2, default: 1).
                   The interrupt pin used by embedded events is hardwired to 1
                   by hardware design.

- interrupts:      interrupt mapping for IRQs. It is recommended to configure
                   them with flags IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH. It is possible to
                   configure an interrupt array of two elements where the first
                   one is related to the accelerometer sensor data interrupt
                   while the second represents the embedded events detection
                   interrupt.

                   Refer to interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt for generic
                   interrupt client node bindings.

Example for an i2c device node (SA0 set to gnd):

lis2dw12-accel@19 {
        compatible = "st,lis2dw12";
        reg = <0x19>;
        interrupt-parent = <&gpio0>;
        interrupts = <0 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
        st,drdy-int-pin = <1>;
        wakeup-source;
};

Example for an spi device node:

lis2dw12-accel@0 {
        compatible = "st,lis2dw12";
        reg = <0x0>;
        spi-max-frequency = <10000000>;
        interrupt-parent = <&gpio0>;
        interrupts = <0 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>, <2 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
        st,drdy-int-pin = <1>;
        wakeup-source;
};
