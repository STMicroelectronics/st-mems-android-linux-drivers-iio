* lis3dhh driver for accel MEMS sensors

Required properties for the spi bindings:
- compatible:      must be one of:
                     "st,lis3dhh"
                     "st,iis3dhhc"

Required properties for the spi bindings:
- reg:             the chipselect index

- spi-max-frequency: maximal bus speed, should be set to 10000000 unless
                     constrained by external circuitry

Optional properties:
- st,drdy-int-pin: the pin on the package that will be used to signal
                   "data ready" (valid values: 1 or 2, default: 1).

- interrupts:      interrupt mapping for IRQ. It should be configured with
                   flags IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH.

                   Refer to interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt for generic
                   interrupt client node bindings.

Example for an spi device node:

lis3dhh-accel@0 {
	compatible = "st,lis3dhh";
	reg = <0x0>;
	spi-max-frequency = <10000000>;
	interrupt-parent = <&gpio0>;
	interrupts = <0 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	st,drdy-int-pin = <1>;
};
