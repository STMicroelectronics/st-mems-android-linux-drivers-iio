* st_acc33 driver for accel MEMS sensors

Required properties for all bus drivers:
- compatible: must be one of:
              "st,lis2dh_accel"
              "st,lis2dh12_accel"
              "st,lis3dh_accel"
              "st,lsm303agr_accel"
              "st,iis2dh_accel"

Required properties for the i2c bindings:
- reg:          i2c slave address

Required properties for the spi bindings:
- reg:               the chipselect index

- spi-max-frequency: maximal bus speed, should be set to 10000000 unless
                     constrained by external circuitry

Optional properties for the spi bindings:
- spi-3wire:    use sensor spi interface with 3 wires.

Optional properties for all bus drivers:
- interrupts:   interrupt mapping for IRQ. It should be configured with
                flags IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH.

                Refer to interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt for generic
                interrupt client node bindings.

- st,module_id: module identifier.
                If a sensor is supported by two different drivers (for example
                accel by this driver and magn by mag40 driver), module_id
                should be used by both drivers and should have the same id.
                This is used by user-space to identify which devices
                are part of the same module (particularly important for
                supporting multiple sensors of the same type).

Example for an spi device node:

lis2dh-accel@0 {
        compatible = "st,lis2dh_accel";
        reg = <0x0>;
        spi-max-frequency = <10000000>;
        interrupt-parent = <&gpio0>;
        interrupts = <0 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
        st,module_id = <1>;
};

Example for an i2c device node:

lis2dh-accel@0x19 {
        compatible = "st,lis2dh_accel";
        reg = <0x19>;
        interrupt-parent = <&gpio0>;
        interrupts = <0 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
        st,module_id = <1>;
};
