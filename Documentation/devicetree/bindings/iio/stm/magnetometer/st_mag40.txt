* st_mag40 driver for magnetometer MEMS sensors

Required properties for all bus drivers:
- compatible: must be one of:
              "st,lsm303ah_magn"
              "st,lsm303agr_magn"
              "st,lis2mdl_magn"
              "st,ism303dac_magn"
              "st,iis2mdc_magn"

Required properties for the i2c bindings:
- reg:          i2c slave address

Required properties for the spi bindings:
- reg:               the chipselect index

- spi-max-frequency: maximal bus speed, should be set to 10000000 unless
                     constrained by external circuitry

Optional properties for the spi bindings:
- spi-3wire:         if device supports 3-wire SPI communication only

Optional properties for all bus drivers:
- interrupts:   interrupt mapping for IRQ. It should be configured with
                flags IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH.

                Refer to interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt for generic
                interrupt client node bindings.

- st,module_id: module identifier.
                If a sensor is supported by two different drivers (for example
                accel by this driver and magn by mag40 driver), module_id
                should be used by both drivers and should have the same id.
                This is used by user-space to identify which devices
                are part of the same module (particularly important for
                supporting multiple sensors of the same type).

Example for an spi device node:

lsm303ah-magn@0 {
        compatible = "st,lsm303ah_magn";
        reg = <0x0>;
        spi-max-frequency = <10000000>;
        interrupt-parent = <&gpio0>;
        interrupts = <0 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
        st,module_id = <1>;
};

Example for an i2c device node:

ism303dac_magn: ism303dac_magn@1e {
        compatible = "st,ism303dac_magn";
        reg = <0x1e>;
        interrupt-parent = <&gpio>;
        interrupts = <20 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
        st,module_id = <1>;
};
