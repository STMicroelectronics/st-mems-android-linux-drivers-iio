* st_mag3d driver for magnetometer MEMS sensors

Required properties for all bus drivers:
- compatible: must be one of:
              "st,lis3mdl_magn"
              "st,lsm9ds1_magn"

Required properties for the i2c bindings:
- reg:        i2c slave address

Required properties for the spi bindings:
- reg:               the chipselect index

- spi-max-frequency: maximal bus speed, should be set to 10000000 unless
                     constrained by external circuitry

Optional properties for all bus drivers:
- interrupts: interrupt mapping for IRQ. It should be configured with
              flags IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH.

              Refer to interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt for generic interrupt
              client node bindings.

Example for an spi device node:

lis3mdl-magn@0 {
        compatible = "st,lis3mdl_magn";
        reg = <0x0>;
        spi-max-frequency = <10000000>;
        interrupt-parent = <&gpio0>;
        interrupts = <0 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
};

Example for an i2c device node:

lis3mdl-magn@0x1e {
        compatible = "st,lis3mdl_magn";
        reg = <0x1e>;
        interrupt-parent = <&gpio0>;
        interrupts = <0 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
};
