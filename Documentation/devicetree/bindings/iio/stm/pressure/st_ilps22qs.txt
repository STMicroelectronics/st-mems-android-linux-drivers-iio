* st_ilps22qs driver for pressure MEMS sensors

Required properties for all bus drivers:
- compatible: must be one of:
	"st,ilps22qs"
	"st,ilps28qsw"

Required properties for the i2c bindings:
- reg: i2c slave address

Required properties for the spi bindings:
- reg:               the chipselect index
- spi-max-frequency: maximal bus speed, should be set to 1000000 unless
                     constrained by external circuitry

Example for an spi device node:

ilps22qs-pressure@0 {
	compatible = "st,ilps22qs";
	reg = <0x0>;
	spi-max-frequency = <1000000>;
};

Example for an i2c device node:

ilps22qs-pressure@5c {
	compatible = "st,ilps22qs";
	reg = <0x5c>;
};
