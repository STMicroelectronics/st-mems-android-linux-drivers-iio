* st_lsm6dsm driver for imu MEMS sensors

Required properties for all bus drivers:
- compatible: must be one of:
              "st,lsm6dsm"
              "st,lsm6dsl"

Required properties for the i2c bindings:
- reg: i2c slave address

Required properties for the spi bindings:
- reg:               the chipselect index

- spi-max-frequency: maximal bus speed, should be set to 10000000 unless
                     constrained by external circuitry

Optional properties for all bus drivers:
- st,drdy-int-pin: the pin on the package that will be used to signal
                   "data ready" (valid values: 1 or 2, default: 1).

- interrupts:      interrupt mapping for IRQ. It should be configured with
                   flags IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH.

                   Refer to interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt for generic interrupt
                   client node bindings.

- st,module_id:    module identifier.
                   This is used by user-space to identify which devices
                   are part of the same module (particularly important for
                   supporting multiple sensors of the same type).

Example for an spi device node:

lsm6dsm-imu@0 {
        compatible = "st,lsm6dsm";
        reg = <0x0>;
        spi-max-frequency = <10000000>;
        interrupt-parent = <&gpio0>;
        interrupts = <0 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
        st,drdy-int-pin = <1>;
        st,module_id = <1>;
};

Example for an i2c device node:

lsm6dsm-imu@6b {
        compatible = "st,lsm6dsm";
        reg = <0x6b>;
        interrupt-parent = <&gpio0>;
        interrupts = <0 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
        st,drdy-int-pin = <1>;
        st,module_id = <1>;
};
