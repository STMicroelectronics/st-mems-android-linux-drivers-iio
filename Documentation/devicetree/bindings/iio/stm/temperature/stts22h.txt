* stts22h driver for temperature MEMS sensors

Required properties for the i2c bindings:
- compatible: must be one of:
              "st,stts22h"

Required properties for the i2c bindings:
- reg: i2c slave address.

Example for an i2c device node:

stts22h-temperature@38 {
        compatible = "st,stts22h";
        reg = <0x38>;
};
