* sths34pf80 driver for TMOS MEMS sensors

Required properties for bindings:
- compatible: must be "st,sths34pf80"

Required properties for the i2c bindings:
- reg: i2c slave address.

Required properties for the spi bindings:
- reg:               the SPI chip select index.

- spi-max-frequency: maximal bus speed, should be set to 10000000 unless
                     constrained by external circuitry.

- spi-3wire:         device supports 3-wire SPI communication only.

Optional properties for all bus drivers:
- interrupt-parent:  identifies the controller node as interrupt-parent
                     (please see kernel Documentation).

- interrupts:        interrupt pin (please see kernel Documentation).

- vdd-supply:        an optional regulator that needs to be on to provide VDD
                     power to the sensor.

- vddio-supply:      an optional regulator that needs to be on to provide the
                     VDD IO power to the sensor.

- interrupts:        interrupt mapping for IRQ. It should be configured
                     with flags IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_BOTH.

                     Refer to interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt for
                     generic interrupt client node bindings.

Example for an i2c device node (i2c address 0x5a):

sths34pf80@5a {
        compatible = "st,sths34pf80";
        reg = <0x5a>;
        interrupt-parent = <&gpio>;
        interrupts = <26 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_BOTH>;
};

Example for an spi device node:

sths34pf80@0 {
        spi-max-frequency = <10000000>;
        compatible = "st,sths34pf80";
        reg = <0>;
        spi-3wire;
        interrupt-parent = <&gpio>;
        interrupts = <13 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_BOTH>;
};
